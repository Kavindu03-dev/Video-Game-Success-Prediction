# Model Roles and Responsibilities

## üéØ Clear Separation of Concerns

### Classification Model (RandomForest)
**Purpose:** Determines if a game is Hit or Not Hit

- **Output:** Binary prediction (Hit/Not Hit) with probability
- **Decision:** Based on learned patterns from successful games
- **Accuracy:** 93%
- **Use Case:** "Will this game be a hit?"

**Example Output:**
```
Prediction: Hit
Probability: 75.3%
```

---

### Regression Model (GradientBoosting)
**Purpose:** Predicts actual sales value in millions

- **Output:** Continuous value (e.g., 2.18M units)
- **Decision:** Estimates how many copies will sell
- **Metrics:** R¬≤=0.33, MAE=0.26M, RMSE=0.70M
- **Use Case:** "How much will this game sell?"

**Example Output:**
```
Predicted Sales: 2.18 million units
```

## üîÑ How They Work Together

### Scenario 1: High Confidence Hit
```
Classification: Hit (85% probability)
Regression: 2.5M units
‚Üí Strong success predicted
```

### Scenario 2: Borderline Case
```
Classification: Not Hit (45% probability)
Regression: 0.9M units
‚Üí Close to threshold, niche success possible
```

### Scenario 3: Clear Not Hit
```
Classification: Not Hit (15% probability)
Regression: 0.3M units
‚Üí Lower sales expected
```

## üìä In the Streamlit App

The app shows both predictions side by side:

1. **Classification Section:**
   - Hit/Not Hit label
   - Probability percentage
   - Visual progress bar

2. **Regression Section:**
   - Predicted sales value
   - No Hit/Not Hit label (this is classification's job!)

3. **Combined Insights:**
   - Classification determines success
   - Regression shows expected magnitude
   - Together they provide complete picture

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

| Model | What It Answers | Output Type | Use For |
|-------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Classification** | Will it be a Hit? | Hit/Not Hit + Probability | Decision making |
| **Regression** | How much will it sell? | Sales in millions | Revenue forecasting |

**Remember:** 
- ‚úÖ Classification = Hit/Not Hit determination
- ‚úÖ Regression = Sales amount prediction
- ‚ùå Don't use regression for Hit/Not Hit classification
- ‚úÖ Use both together for complete insights

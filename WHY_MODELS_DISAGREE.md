# Prince of Persia: Why Models Disagree

## The Short Answer

**Classification is NOT checking if sales > 1.0M!**

It's checking: **"Do most games LIKE THIS become hits?"**

## Why This Happens

### Classification says:
> "Most Adventure/PS2 games fail. This is probably like most others."
> 
> **Based on:** Historical category performance  
> **Probability:** 32.67% (most similar games failed)

### Regression says:
> "But THIS game has exceptional quality indicators!"
> 
> **Based on:** THIS game's specific features  
> **Prediction:** 2.97M units (high quality = high sales)

## The Truth

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BOTH MODELS ARE CORRECT!                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│  Classification: "Risky category" ✓         │
│  → 67% of Adventure/PS2 games DO fail       │
│                                             │
│  Regression: "Quality game" ✓               │
│  → THIS game has features that predict      │
│    high sales despite category risk         │
│                                             │
│  Result: SUCCESS DESPITE THE ODDS           │
│  → Prince of Persia is a QUALITY OUTLIER    │
│                                             │

## Simple Analogy

### It's like a student from a struggling school:

```
CLASSIFICATION:
"Students from School X rarely get into Harvard"
→ Low probability (32.67%)
→ TRUE: The school has low acceptance rate

REGRESSION:
"But THIS student has perfect SAT, great essays, strong GPA"
→ High predicted success
→ TRUE: This student is exceptional

RESULT:
Student gets into Harvard! ✅
→ Quality individual beat the odds
→ Prince of Persia did the same!
```

## What You Should Do

### When you see disagreement (Low Classification + High Regression):

1. ✅ **This is VALUABLE information!**
   - Not a bug, it's a feature!
   - Shows a potential quality outlier

2. ✅ **Check the quality signals:**
   - Is critic score high? (9.0 ✓)
   - Is publisher strong? (Ubisoft ✓)
   - Is developer quality? (Ubisoft Montreal ✓)

3. ✅ **Assess risk vs reward:**
   - Classification: "Risky bet" (32.67%)
   - Regression: "Big potential" (2.97M)
   - Decision: "High risk, HIGH REWARD"

4. ✅ **Make informed decision:**
   - If you believe in quality → GO
   - If you're risk-averse → PASS
   - Prince of Persia: Going paid off!

## Quick FAQ

**Q: Shouldn't classification say "Hit" if regression predicts >1M?**

A: No! Classification learned that Adventure/PS2 games usually fail.
   It's showing you the RISK. Regression shows you the POTENTIAL.

**Q: Which model is "right"?**

A: BOTH are right!
   - Classification: Right about category risk
   - Regression: Right about this game's quality
   - Together: Complete picture

**Q: Should I trust regression over classification?**

A: Use BOTH:
   - Classification → Risk assessment
   - Regression → Reward potential
   - Decision → Your call based on both

**Q: What if they agree?**

A: That's easier!
   - Both say Hit → High confidence
   - Both say Not Hit → High confidence
   - Disagreement → Interesting case (like Prince of Persia!)

---

**Bottom Line:** Prince of Persia was a quality game in a risky category. 
Models correctly identified BOTH the risk AND the potential. The game 
succeeded by being the exception, not the rule. This is EXACTLY the kind 
of insight you want from having two models! 🎯

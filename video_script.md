**Narrator:** "Now let's see the results. Our system provides two predictions:"

**[Scene: Show classification results]**

**Narrator:** "The classification model predicts this will be a Hit with 78% probability, indicating strong commercial potential."

**[Scene: Show regression results]**

**Narrator:** "The regression model estimates 2.3 million units in sales, well above our 1 million threshold."

**[Scene: Show combined insights]**

**Narrator:** "The combined insights confirm this is a strong candidate for investment, with both models agreeing on success potential."

#### **Demo 2: Batch Processing (3:00 - 3:45) - 45 seconds**

**[Scene: Navigate to batch prediction]**

**Narrator:** "For portfolio analysis, we can process multiple games simultaneously. Let me add several games to our batch prediction table:"

**[Scene: Add multiple games to batch]**

**Narrator:** "I'll add games across different genres and platforms to demonstrate the system's versatility."

**[Scene: Show batch results]**

**Narrator:** "The system automatically computes predictions for all games, showing hit probabilities and sales estimates. We can export these results for further analysis."

**[Scene: Download CSV]**

**Narrator:** "Results can be downloaded as CSV for integration with other business tools."

#### **Demo 3: Data Analytics (3:45 - 4:30) - 45 seconds**

**[Scene: Navigate to Explore page]**

**Narrator:** "Our system also includes comprehensive analytics. Let's explore sales trends by genre:"

**[Scene: Show genre analysis chart]**

**Narrator:** "We can see that action and sports games dominate the market, with clear visualizations of sales distribution."

# Total Sales Prediction - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

You now have a **complete dual prediction system** that provides:
1. **Classification**: Whether a game will be a "Hit" (≥1.0M sales) or "Not Hit"
2. **Regression**: Predicted total sales value in million units

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

5. **`models/regressor_metrics.json`** (Model metadata)

### Modified Files
1. **`src/preprocess.py`**
   - Added `build_preprocessor_regression()` function
   - Handles preprocessing for regression task (predicts total_sales directly)

2. **`src/app.py`** (Streamlit app)
   - Loads both classifier and regressor models
   - Added `predict_sales()` function for regression predictions
   - Updated Predict page to show BOTH predictions:
     - Hit classification with probability
     - Total sales prediction with value in million units
   - Enhanced UI with better layout

## 🚀 How to Use

### Training the Regression Model

```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if using)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell

# Train regression model
python src/train_regression.py
```

**Output:**
- `models/best_regressor.joblib` - Trained model
- `models/regressor_metrics.json` - Performance metrics

### Testing Predictions

```bash
# Test both models together
python test_dual_prediction.py
```

### Running the Streamlit App

```bash
# Make sure both models are trained
python src/train.py          # Classification model
python src/train_regression.py  # Regression model

# Run the app
streamlit run src/app.py
```

**In the app:**
1. Go to "Predict" page
2. Select game details (genre, console, publisher, developer, critic score)
3. Click "Predict"
4. See both:
   - **Hit Classification**: "Hit" or "Not Hit" with probability
   - **Total Sales Prediction**: Predicted sales in million units

## 📊 Model Performance

### Classification Model (Best: Random Forest)
- Accuracy: ~93%
- F1 Score: ~0.43
- Task: Predict if total_sales ≥ 1.0M

### Regression Model (Best: Gradient Boosting)
- R² Score: 0.3286 (explains 33% of variance)
- MAE: 0.2603 million units
- RMSE: 0.7008 million units
- Task: Predict actual total_sales value

**Note:** R² of 0.33 is reasonable for sales prediction given the inherent uncertainty in game success. This means:
- The model is significantly better than just predicting the mean
- There's room for improvement with more features
- Predictions are useful for relative comparisons

## 🔧 Architecture

```
Input Features (same for both models):
├── genre (categorical)
├── console (categorical)
├── publisher (categorical)
├── developer (categorical)
├── critic_score (numeric)
└── release_year (numeric)

Classification Output:
└── Hit probability (0.0 to 1.0)

Regression Output:
└── Predicted sales (0.0 to 20+ million units)
```

## 💡 Use Cases

### When to Use Classification
- Quick yes/no decision: "Should we greenlight this project?"
- Risk assessment: "What's the probability of success?"
- Binary filtering: "Show me only games likely to be hits"

### When to Use Regression
- Financial planning: "What revenue can we expect?"
- Resource allocation: "Which project has highest sales potential?"
- Detailed forecasting: "Estimate sales for next quarter"

### Combined Approach (Recommended)
- Use both predictions together for robust decision-making
- Classification gives you the "success threshold" perspective
- Regression gives you the "expected value" perspective
- Disagreements between models highlight edge cases

## 📈 Example Predictions

### Example 1: High-quality AAA Game
```
Input:
  Genre: action
  Console: ps4
  Publisher: sony computer entertainment
  Developer: naughty dog
  Critic Score: 9.5
  Year: 2020

Classification: Not Hit (41.33% probability) ⚠️
Regression: 2.18 million units ✓

Interpretation: Mixed signals. Model predicts >1M sales but
below hit probability threshold. Suggests moderate success.
```

### Example 2: Indie Game
```
Input:
  Genre: puzzle
  Console: pc
  Publisher: indie studio
  Developer: indie studio
  Critic Score: 7.2
  Year: 2023

Classification: Not Hit (15% probability) ✗
Regression: 0.08 million units ✗

Interpretation: Both agree - likely niche appeal with limited sales.
```

## 🎨 UI Updates in Streamlit

### Before
- Only showed Hit/Not Hit classification
- Single prediction button
- No sales value estimate

### After
- Shows both classification AND regression
- Clear separation between the two predictions
- "Predict" button (styled as primary)
- Two sections:
  1. **Hit Classification** with prediction label and probability
  2. **Total Sales Prediction** with value in million units
- Info message if regressor not trained yet

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

### 1. Frontend Integration (React)
Update `frontend/src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
export const predictDual = async (gameData) => {
  const response = await apiCall('/predict/dual', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(gameData)
  })
  return {
    classification: response.hit_prediction,
    probability: response.hit_probability,
    predicted_sales: response.predicted_sales
  }
}
```

### 2. Confidence Intervals
Add prediction intervals to show uncertainty:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
# Use predict with return_std=True for RF
# Or bootstrap predictions for confidence intervals
```

### 3. Feature Importance Comparison
Show which features matter most for each task

### 4. Ensemble Predictions
Combine multiple models for better accuracy:
```python
# Weighted average of RF, GB, and XGBoost
predictions = (rf_pred * 0.4 + gb_pred * 0.4 + xgb_pred * 0.2)
```

### 5. Time-based Validation
Split by release year to avoid data leakage

### 6. Regional Breakdowns
Predict sales by region (NA, EU, JP, Other) separately

## 📚 Documentation

- [x] Model saved successfully
- [x] Metrics saved to JSON
- [x] Test script works
- [x] Streamlit app updated

## 🎉 Summary

You can now predict both:
1. **Will it be a hit?** → Classification model
2. **How much will it sell?** → Regression model

Both models use the same features and preprocessing, making them easy to use together. The Streamlit app now shows both predictions side-by-side, giving you comprehensive insights into game success potential.

Run `streamlit run src/app.py` to see it in action!
